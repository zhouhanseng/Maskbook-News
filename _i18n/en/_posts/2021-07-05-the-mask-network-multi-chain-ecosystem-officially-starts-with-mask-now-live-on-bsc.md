$MASK, the native token of Mask Network, is now a cross-chain asset, marking the official start of the Mask Network multi-chain ecosystem. Mask Network has finished bridging $MASK from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The bridge from Ethereum to Polygon will be available soon.

$MASK is now available on BSC Network, the token contract is: [**0x2ed9a5c8c13b93955103b9a7c167b67ef4d568a3**](https://bscscan.com/token/0x2ed9a5c8c13b93955103b9a7c167b67ef4d568a3)

The Red Packet plugin in the Mask extension now supports the BSC network and Polygon, so users could create, send, and receive encrypted Red Packets with any assets on BSC and Polygon directly on Twitter, using the two networks. In the future, Mask Network will continue developing its core functions on the two networks, such as ITO and Swaps.

Mask Network received the strategic investment from Binance this April, and both parties aim to build a multi-chain metaverse that includes Binance Smart Chain. The completion of the cross-chain asset bridge is a key step for Mask Network to enter the Web 3.0 multi-chain era. The boundary of the Mask Network ecosystem has now expanded to BSC. Mask Network will cooperate with all sorts of amazing projects in the BSC ecosystem and take outstanding applications on BSC onto the Mask Network in a fast and seamless way, to attract more users to play in the more efficient and convenient Web 3.0 multi-chain universe.

**About Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**

Binance Smart Chain was launched in April 2020 as the parallel blockchain of the current Binance Chain. BSC boasts smart contract functionality and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The design goal here was to leave the high throughput of the Binance chain intact while introducing smart contracts into its ecosystem.

**About Polygon**

Polygon provides a cost-effective, speedy cross-chain solution. Polygon is a Layer2 solution blockchain, which provides scalable, secure, and instant Ethereum transactions using Plasma side-chains and a Proof-of-Stake network.

**About Mask Network**

Mask Network is the core product of Dimension, which is positioned to become the bridge that connects internet users from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. The foundational technology of Mask Network is a peer-to-peer encrypted messaging application, with new functions continuously being created around this foundation. We at Mask Network are strong believers in the ownership economy. People should own what they produce, people should own their data, their attention, and the virtual space they choose to contribute to.

Mask Network integrates decentralized social messaging, borderless payment network, decentralized file storage and sharing, decentralized finance, DAO, and NFT to provide a safe and convenient portal for users to jump right into the continent of decentralized finance and then the new world of Web 3.0.
