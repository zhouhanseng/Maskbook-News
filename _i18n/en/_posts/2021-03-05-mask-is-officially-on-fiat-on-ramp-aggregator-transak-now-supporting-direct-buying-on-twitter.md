Mask Network has finished the public launch of the governance token **$MASK** through **ITO** and **LBP**, which raised significant attention from crypto-assets users around the globe.

We are thrilled to see buying enthusiasm the public has on the $MASK token. We hereby announce that the $MASK token is officially on **Transak**, the fiat on-ramp aggregator endorsed by ConsenSys. **Users can buy $MASK tokens directly using fiat money, without leaving Twitter.**

Type “**$MASK”** in the Twitter search bar, click “**buy now**" and you are all set to purchase, no extra actions needed.

Under the technical support of Transak, now we are supporting legal fiat onramp channels from over 50 countries around the world, to purchase crypto-assets such as $BTC and $ETH directly on Twitter.

Meanwhile, Mask Network will try to promote $MASK token towards the public sight, seeking collaborations with various decentralized projects, to further push the development of open finance, and build a bridge connecting Web 2.0 and Web 3.0.
