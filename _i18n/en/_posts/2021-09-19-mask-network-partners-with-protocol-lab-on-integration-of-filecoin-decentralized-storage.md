Mask Network announces it is receiving strategic support from [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) to help build a foundation for their future developments and innovations. The Mask Network seeks to be the bridge between the existing web2 and the new, open web3 by introducing web3 applications upon the mainstream social network, which is why integration with distributed and open-source technologies in Protocol Labs’ focus areas, such as Filecoin, is a major milestone for the Web 3.0 ecosystem. This partnership also involves $MASK in our DAO treasury and $FIL. Please read [this post](https://we.mask.io/t/announcement-protocol-labs-purchased-mask-from-the-maskdao-treasury/495) in our governance forum for more information.

Mask recently announced a collaboration with the [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/mask-network-x-filecoin-bridging-the-gap-between-web2-and-web3/) ecosystem in which Protocol Labs is a major contributor. Filecoin is one of the leaders in decentralized storage networks and provides a foundation to store humanity’s most important information. Filecoin provides an alternative to an essential web service: make information and data perpetual, but in a decentralized way. The grant from Protocol Labs will provide foundational infrastructure and serve as a cornerstone for the decentralized world that the web3 ecosystem is striving to build.

Mask will work with Filecoin in the promotion of web3 concepts. With the help of Filecoin, Mask will explore more areas of decentralized technology while expanding the ecosystem to provide more options for users using dapps with the Mask extension.

> “_Mask Network is a key innovator bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. We’re delighted that the Filecoin integration will help bring next generation decentralized storage solutions to the Mask platform and their very engaged users. The Filecoin community is excited to lean into this collaboration and ultimately help accelerate the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 tech._”

Mask Network looks to benefit with the support from Protocol Labs for their valuable insight and experience in relevant fields. Mask Network is looking forward to collaborating with them in the open, free metaverse.
